-- FAQ --


-- GENERAL --

Q: What IDE should I use for Minetest?

Visual Studio 2017 or 2019. We haven't run it on later versions (try at your own risk)

Q: How long does setup take?

About 30 mins (if everything goes right)

Q: There are red errors/libraries missing in CMake. Is that a concern?

As long as you can configure then generate without missing any libraries critical for Minetest, you should be fine.

Q: What is the team workflow on Github?

Make your own branch, then make a pull request to merge your branch into Native-Api. Have another teammate review your PR.


-- KNOWN COMMON ERRORS --

Q: Missing Jsapi.h -> Redo project (Minetest) settings, double check BUILD_DBJ.obj files

Q: Issue with winnit.h -> change project SDK version (look at WIN 11 addendum for version, or keep going back versions until it runs)

Q: Unresolved external symbol -> Either A) you are missing headers/function definition B) Missing an entry for newly added file in the CmakeLists.txt

Q: Missing random header you didn't add/misc strange erro -> Repair Visual Studio (Search Visual studio installer in Windows)

Note: when you make a new class, the files must be added to the CmakeLists.txt file for Cmake to compile it (this file will likely be in the same
location of the file you will add (there are multiple Cmakelists.txt files at every hierarchy level

Q: I switched to a new branch do I need to redo the project properties? YES

-- MAKING CLASSES FAQ --

Q: What files do I need to create for my new class? -> native_newClass.cpp, native_newClass.h newClass.lua (test file) also modify the existing C++ and headers to 
create copies that will call the native functions (i.e "wrapper functions")

Q: My lua test function output is not expected (random memory address/garbage) -> use ..dump(result) to print lua table output or ..tostring(result)

Q: What do I call my test functions? -> Every test follows a naming scheme to work with the automatic testing framework [lua/native/test_classNAME_functionNAME)
